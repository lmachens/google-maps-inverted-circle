# lmachens:google-maps-inverted-circle

In Google Map Javascript API the regular Circle has an option to fill the inside of circle with a color, but there is no option to fill the outside of the circle. After lots of searching in Google and reading Google Map Javascript API, when I didn't find any solution, then I started to build my own library to draw an InvertedCircle. I used google.maps.MVCObject class to give same functionality as regular Circle of  Google Map Javascript API

## Installation

```
    meteor add lmachens:google-maps-inverted-circle
```
